## Disclaimer
Just so you know, this project is a labor of love and a work in progress. I'm always tinkering and making improvements, so you can expect things to evolve. Unfortunately, I can't guarantee that the data is always 100% accurate.

## Data Sources
To make all of this happen, I rely on a couple of data sources:

- **IRIS:** [Timetable data and train order](https://iris.noncd.db.de/wbt/js/index.html)
- **HAFAS (JS Wrapper):** [Additional information](https://github.com/public-transport/hafas-client/)

A big shoutout to derf from finalrewind.org for sparking the inspiration that got this project going!
